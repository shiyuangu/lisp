Tasks that need to be accomplished in order for a release to happen.

* 5.3 release (future)

** Documentation

*** Finish items marked with "@c PRE5_3" in the documentation.

** Source

*** Make erc-backend not need to (require) any other part of ERC.
This will hopefully increase the chance that it will be useful for
other IRC clients, like Circe.

*** Make erc-nicklist into a proper ERC module.

* 5.2 release

** Documentation

*** [DONE] Finish items marked with "@c PRE5_2" in the documentation.

*** [DONE] Update NEWS for changes since 5.1.4.

** Source

*** [DONE] Add binding for S-TAB (backtab) that moves backwards by link.

*** [DONE] Merge filename changes from the 5.2 release branch into the
erc--main--0 branch.

* Emacs 22 release

** Source

*** [DONE] Make M-x erc start a session.
New users never think of using M-x erc-select.

*** [DONE] Change keybinding definitions for `erc-track-switch-buffer'.
`C-c C-SPC' / `C-c C-@' is set as a global keybinding and is known to
conflict with rcirc, for example.  Would setting `erc-track-mode-map'
work?  Otherwise we could encourage people to use something like
`C-c e SPC' or `C-c c'.

Solution: We went with a global minor mode which does nothing but set
the global-level C-c C-SPC and C-c C-@ keybindings.  It defaults to
warning the user if one of their keybindings would be overridden, so
this solution should be OK to install in Emacs.

*** [DONE] Make a tarball with the modules that weren't included with
Emacs 22 that can be downloaded from GNU's ftp server.

This is now available as "erc-5.2-extras.(tar.gz|zip)" at
ftp.gnu.org/gnu/erc/.  It may be built with "make extras" and uploaded
with "make upload-extras".

* 5.1 release (old)

** [DONE] Documentation

*** ERC's manual needs collaborative effort.
Some conditions follow.

Manual text can be based off of pages from EmacsWiki.org, but must be
rewritten.  As long as they're not too close to being word-for-word,
you should be okay.

Contributors to the documentation must have assigned future copyright
for ERC or Emacs.  No separate manual assignment is needed in this
case.  If you haven't assigned future changes and would like to work
on the manual, contact mwolson@gnu.org.

*** Search for "@c PRE5_1" to see what needs to be done before the
5.1 release.

Please add your name in brackets after "PRE5_1" in the comment if you
wish to work an item in the short term.

** [DONE] Makefile

*** install target needed.
This could look at the following new variables.  ELISPDIR determines
where to install ERC.  INFODIR is where manual will be installed.

PREFIX   = /usr/local
ELISPDIR = $(PREFIX)/share/emacs/site-lisp/erc
INFODIR  = $(PREFIX)/info

*** install-info target needed.
Something like the following would work.

%.info: %.texi
	makeinfo $<

install-info: muse.info
	[ -d $(INFODIR) ] || install -d $(INFODIR)
	install -m 0644 muse.info $(INFODIR)/muse
	$(INSTALLINFO) $(INFODIR)/muse

** [DONE] NEWS: Update for changes since 5.0.4.

** [DONE] Source

*** Remove dependency on cl package.
(eval-when-compile (require 'cl)) is acceptable.
